    "The actual data collection using twitter was performed using twitter Open API's standard account, which is the free version of twitter's API service. The free version comes with several limitations. For one thing, the API only collects data from recent 7 days. The problem with this was that it limited the scope of subjects we can analyze. If a particular topic isn't a popular topic at the moment, there were only around maybe 3000~4000 tweets available using the Open API (I experienced this issue using keywords such as 'tesla', 'samsung galaxy s8', 'machine learning')\n",
    "\n",
    "I originally wanted to perform analysis on people's opinion on a firm or a product. The problem is if a product has been out for a while, amongst the sprase number of tweets that were collected, majority of them were advertisements, which are pretty much noise in our data analysis. Clearly, if the same analysis was performed within a short period of time when a product was released, we could perform a more meaningful topic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, I was limited to choosing a topic that was fairly recent and gained attention of a large population. As of the timeline when this project was conducted (late December, 2017), Trump has officially declared that U.S will recognize Jerusalem as official capital of Israel, and I wanted to see how topics regarding Jerusalem were spread out. When I performed the analysis, I was easily able to amass 80,000 tweets, although some were filtered out in the end because they were too short to have any meaningful context."
